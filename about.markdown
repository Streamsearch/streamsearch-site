I am **Saeed Shahsavan**, a **Software Architect** with over 18 years of experience designing and implementing large-scale, cloud-native systems. My background spans distributed platforms, enterprise integration, and high-performance backend engineering, with a strong focus on clarity, correctness, and architectural rigor.

My work focuses on:

**Distributed Systems & Microservices** — designing resilient, observable, and scalable services

**Software Architecture & System Design** — boundaries, contracts, domain modeling, integration patterns

**Enterprise Search & Data Platforms** — Elasticsearch, Lucene, Neo4j, indexing strategies, relevance tuning

**Event-Driven Architectures** — CQRS, Event Sourcing, streaming systems (Kafka, Pulsar)

**High-Performance Backend Engineering** — Go and Java with attention to memory, concurrency, and profiling

Over the years, I have designed and built systems for banking, telecom, government, and large-scale data platforms. My approach blends clean architectural thinking with practical, production-grade engineering, ensuring systems that are maintainable today and adaptable tomorrow.

I am currently working on my upcoming book:

**Building Enterprise Projects with Go** — a practical guide to designing scalable, production-ready systems with clarity, discipline, and long-term maintainability.
