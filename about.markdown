# About StreamSearch

StreamSearch is a real-time, distributed search platform built for organizations that need fast indexing, scalable retrieval, and AI-ready data pipelines. Inspired by modern streaming architectures, StreamSearch blends the reliability of Apache Kafka and Pulsar with the power of Lucene to deliver enterprise-grade search with predictable performance at scale.

## What StreamSearch Solves

**Real-Time Search Over Event Streams**  
Index documents the moment they arrive—no batch delays, no bottlenecks.

**Distributed & Fault-Tolerant Architecture**  
Sharded indexing, replicated consumers, and horizontal scalability designed for high-throughput systems.

**Search for the AI Era**  
Vector search, hybrid ranking, zero-knowledge architecture, and integration with LLM-based retrieval pipelines.

**Flexible Ingestion for Enterprise Data**  
Kafka, Pulsar, API ingestion, file plugins, JDBC sources, and content pipelines backed by MinIO and cloud object storage.

**Elastic-Style Developer Experience**  
Search, index, and query APIs that feel familiar—simplified for clarity but optimized for streaming.

## Technology Foundations

StreamSearch is built on technologies proven in large-scale, production environments:

- **Lucene** for high-performance indexing and relevance  
- **Kafka / Pulsar** for distributed ingestion and query routing  
- **MinIO** for durable, S3-compatible object storage  
- **Prometheus** for metrics and operational visibility  

## Why StreamSearch Exists

Traditional search engines were designed for static documents.  
Modern systems run on **streams**.

StreamSearch bridges the gap — combining the power of real-time ingestion with search semantics, ranking, analytics, and plug-and-play extensibility. Enterprises get fast search, predictable costs, and complete architectural transparency.

## Built by Saeed Shahsavan

StreamSearch is created and architected by **Saeed Shahsavan**, a Software Architect with 18+ years of experience in distributed systems, enterprise integration, event-driven platforms, and search engine design.

He is also the author of the upcoming book:

**_Building Enterprise Projects with Go_** — a practical guide to designing scalable and maintainable systems.
